Gravinate is a simple game where you need to navigate the startship Alas through the asteroid field to get to the objective. Once you get to the objective you start a new level. Each level is bigger and faster.

In order to navigate through the asteroid field you have an initial forward speed and you can move to the sides with the L and R buttons. To turn you will orbit around the strong-gravity asteroids in a slingshot maneuver.
